# Nintendo Switch 2 Rumor Bingo

A brutally honest little web app for predicting ‚Äî and emotionally preparing for ‚Äî the inevitable catastrophe that is the Nintendo Switch 2. This isn‚Äôt just a game. It‚Äôs grief counseling with clickables.

## Why This Exists

I made this for Russ, because we both need to start the mourning process early. The Switch 2 is coming, and it‚Äôs going to hurt. We're talking **sub-540p handheld resolution**, **15fps on a good day**, and a GPU that was obsolete before the pandemic even began. Every frame will look like it‚Äôs being airmailed through molasses, and each game will feel like a tech demo made for the **iPhone 3GS**, only blurrier and somehow... wetter?

Of course, the games will be "charmingly" designed for **middle-aged Japanese businessmen who believe they‚Äôre actually high school girls**, and every marketing video will show someone playing it joyfully in a sunlit Tokyo loft, instead of hunched over a creaking Joy-Con in the dead of night, quietly whispering ‚Äúwhy do I still believe?‚Äù

This bingo card is for us ‚Äî the fools. The believers. The spiritually bankrupt clingers-on who somehow convinced ourselves that **this time** Nintendo would try. They won‚Äôt. But at least now we can predict *how* they‚Äôll let us down.

## How It Works

- Click **"Generate New Card"** to receive your random permutation of nightmare fuel.
- Click a cell to mark the box that just came true.
- When you've marked five in a row ‚Äî across, down, or diagonally ‚Äî the app flashes "BINGO!" to signify that your optimism has officially flatlined.
- The URL updates live to save your card and your shame. Share it with a friend or future therapist.
